I actually wanted more practice with oop and external servers afer a chaotic week happened to me.

I needed to prove I could make it work as opposed to my last one. And having a place to store names will come in handy in the future.

My project outside of my personal life solves the issue of forgetting who I need to write notes about.

In doing this I learned a lot about data paths and I really think I understand them now. Also I learned a few people will go above and beyond to fix a problem that stumps 3 professionals in a row!
